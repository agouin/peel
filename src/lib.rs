//! `peel` — streaming, resumable, space-efficient extraction of compressed
//! archives downloaded over HTTP.
//!
//! See [`docs/PLAN.md`] in the repository for the implementation plan and
//! [`docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`] for the rules every module follows.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! Each module is added in the order described by the plan; this crate
//! root grows as new layers come online. The current layers are:
//!
//! - [`types`] — strongly-typed primitives (`ByteOffset`, `ChunkIndex`,
//!   `ByteRange`) shared across the codebase.
//! - [`error`] — documentation of the per-module typed-error convention.
//! - [`punch`] (Unix only) — the `PunchHole` trait and Linux/no-op
//!   implementations used to release blocks of the compressed source as
//!   the decoder advances.
//!
//! - [`bitmap`] — lock-free chunk completion bitmap shared across the
//!   download workers, scheduler, and decoder.
//! - [`download`] (Unix only) — the sparse output file, the chunk
//!   scheduler, and the per-chunk worker that issues ranged GETs.
//! - [`http`] — hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 client with connection pooling and
//!   TLS via `rustls`, plus the typed [`http::request`] /
//!   [`http::response`] / [`http::range`] / [`http::url`] support
//!   modules.
//! - [`decode`] — the [`decode::StreamingDecoder`] protocol every
//!   format-specific decoder honors, plus the in-tree zstd
//!   implementation and a suffix-keyed [`decode::DecoderRegistry`].
//! - [`sink`] — the [`sink::Sink`] trait every extraction target
//!   honors, the always-quiescent [`sink::RawSink`], and the
//!   member-aligned streaming [`sink::TarSink`].
//! - [`extractor`] (Unix only) — the [`extractor::Extractor`]
//!   coordinator that drives a decoder + sink + puncher loop and
//!   punches the source behind quiescent checkpoints.
//! - [`checkpoint`] — crash-safe persistence of a download +
//!   extraction in progress: the [`checkpoint::Checkpoint`] struct,
//!   its tiny custom binary format, and the atomic
//!   write-to-temp-then-rename dance that makes resume safe.
//! - [`coordinator`] (Unix only) — the §10 entry point that wires
//!   download + extractor + checkpoint into a single resumable
//!   pipeline. The `peel` binary calls into [`coordinator::run`]
//!   after parsing CLI flags.
//! - [`zip`] — ZIP archive support (parsers, sink, per-entry
//!   pipeline). ZIP's central-directory-at-the-end design forces a
//!   different pipeline shape than the streaming decoders in
//!   [`decode`]; see `docs/PLAN_v2.md` §5.
//! - [`progress`] — multi-field progress tracking (`PLAN_v2.md` §6):
//!   shared `ProgressState` updated by writers (workers, extractor,
//!   ZIP pipeline) plus a TTY / log renderer the binary spawns at
//!   the boundary.
//! - [`io_backend`] (Unix only) — file-IO seam (`PLAN_v2.md` §7):
//!   the [`io_backend::IoBackend`] trait every backend honors, the
//!   always-available [`io_backend::BlockingBackend`] wrapping
//!   `pwrite`/`pread`/`fsync`, and (Linux only) the
//!   `io_backend::UringBackend` that batches submissions across
//!   workers through a dedicated IO thread. The `--io-backend` CLI
//!   flag picks between `auto` (default; tries uring, falls back to
//!   blocking with a warning), `blocking`, and `uring`.
